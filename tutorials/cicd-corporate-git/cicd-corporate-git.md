    ![Add subaccount pop-up in the SAP Connectivity service](add-subaccount.png)

3. Choose **Save**.


### Create a virtual system and map it to your corporate Git


In the SAP Connectivity service, add a system mapping and a resource.

1. From the navigation pane in the SAP Connectivity service, choose the display name of your subaccount **&rarr;** **Cloud To On-Premise**.

2. To map a new system, choose **+** *(Add)*.

3. In the **Add System Mapping** pop-up, select **Non-SAP System** as **Back-end Type** and choose **Next**.

4. From the drop-down list, select the protocol of your on-premise Git server, and choose **Next**.

5. Enter your internal host and port, and choose **Next**.

6. For **Virtual Host**, enter `my-git`, and for **Virtual Port**, enter `1080`.

	Thereby, you'll create a virtual host that can be reached through `http://my-git:1080`. The virtual host is also needed to configure CI/CD jobs in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

    * **Name:** Freely choose a unique name for your repository. We recommend using a name that refers to the actual repository in your source code management system.
    * **Clone URL:** Enter a composition of the virtual host you've created in step 3.6 and the path of the resource you've created in step 3.13, for example `http://my-git:1080/user/repository`. Please make sure that you use the virtual host instead of the real host name and port of your on-premise system.
    * **Credentials:** If your repository isn't private, leave this field empty.
    * **Cloud Connector:** From the drop-down list, choose your Cloud Connector credential.


### Add a webhook in GitHub

Configure a webhook between your GitHub repository and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery to automate the builds of your job.

A webhook with GitHub allows you to automate SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery builds: Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, a webhook push event is sent to the service to trigger a build of the connected job.

The following graphic illustrates this flow:

![CI/CD service flow when using a webhook](webhook-flow.png)

1. In the **WEBHOOK EVENT RECEIVER** section of the **Add Repository** pane, choose **GitHub** as **Type** from the drop-down list.

2. In the **Webhook Credential** drop-down list, choose **Create Credentials**.

3. In the **Create Credentials** pop-up, enter a name for your credential, which is unique in your SAP BTP subaccount, for example **`webhook`**.
   
4. Choose **Generate** next to **Secret** to generate a random token string.
   
    >**Caution:** Note down the secret as you won't be able to see it again.

5. Choose **Create**.
   
6. Choose **Add**.

7. In the **Repositories** tab in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, choose your repository.
   
8. In your repository pane, choose **...** → **Webhook Data**.
   
    ![Way to access webhook data](webhook-data.png)

     ![Deploy to CF Space in the UI](CICD_deploystep.png)

7. Switch all other stages off and choose **Create**.
   
    >**Note:** As this tutorial focuses on how to get started with SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, we've decided to configure only a very basic CI/CD pipeline in it. For how to configure more elaborate ones, see [Supported Pipelines](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/sap-continuous-integration-and-delivery/supported-pipelines?language=en-US&version=Cloud).

8. To run your CI/CD pipeline, create and commit a code change in your GitHub project.

    As a result, a build of the connected job is triggered and a new build tile appears in the **Builds** section of your job. If you choose it, the **Build Stages** view opens and you can watch the individual stages of your build run through.

    >**Note:** The pipeline run might take a few minutes.

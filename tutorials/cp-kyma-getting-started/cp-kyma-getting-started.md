### Enable Kyma environment

To enable SAP BTP, Kyma runtime on your cluster you must make sure that your subaccount has the right entitlements. Follow this procedure to learn how to set up your Kyma entitlement and enable SAP BTP, Kyma runtime in your subaccount.

> If you can see **Kyma Environment** in the subaccountâ€™s Overview section, it means that the Kyma entitlement is already set up. In such a case, go straight to Step 5.   

1. In your Free Tier subaccount, go to **Entitlements**.

2. Choose **Edit** and **Add Service Plans**.

3. Find **Kyma Runtime**, select one of the available plans, and choose **Add Service Plan**.
   
4. Choose **Save**, and go back to the subaccount's Overview.

5. Choose **Enable Kyma** to trigger the enablement of the Kyma environment.

    In the background, a new Kubernetes cluster is being set up where SAP BTP, Kyma runtime will run. This might take between 15-25 minutes.

    To continue with this tutorial, you must wait until the enablement is finished. You can still use the SAP BTP Free Tier or close the window as the setup process will continue automatically.
